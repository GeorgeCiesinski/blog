My name is George Ciesinski. I am an avid life-long student and spend much of my free time learning something new. I work as an IT professional and have had several IT jobs where I provided different kinds of support for clients. Although I enjoy this job, my dream is to become a proficient programmer and to get a job as a software developer. There's something about the challenge and the opportunity to build something others might find useful or efficient. 

I studied Electromechanical Engineering - Robotics & Automation in Humber College where I learned an array of different skills. The program prepared me for a career in automation, so I picked up a wide array of skills. A part of the program was learning about the physical processes, such as designing an automation line, material science, machining, and welding. We also learned lots of programming skills. As this was an automation class, we learned how to program various types of PLCs, articulated robots, and build computer software that can be used to interface with PLCs and Robots. 

The skills were invaluable to me, but my interests began to shift. First they started moving more towards computer science, and open source crafting. I started working with a 3D printer, and was learning more programming languages in an attempt to find something that grabbed my interest. Eventually, I discovered Python, which was exactly what I was looking for. This language made sense to me, and seemed so powerful. I devoted hundreds of hours to learning Python. Now, I am finally at the point where I can not only build small public projects in Python, but at a point where I have an idea of what kind of scope to have for my blog.
