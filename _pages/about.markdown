Hello, I am George Ciesinski! I am an eager programmer who enjoys spending their free time working on new projects. I like building all sorts of things such as specialized tools to work more efficiently, APIs, and websites. I also like tinkering, including setting up various Raspberry Pi servers, and occasionally, 3D printing.

I earned a Technologist Diploma in "Electro-mechanical Engineering - Robotics & Automation" where I learned how to design, build, and program for the purpose of automation. During my studies, I found a love for programming, and have been studying it ever since. I learned Python and started to work on numerous projects. I built a program named TextScript for my current job which allows create text templates and recall them at any time by typing a shortcut. This program was adopted by a few departments in my company, and I received great feedback from the various users who found that the tool was able to make their work easier. This only motovated me to pursue more projects, and start working to switch careers so I could program for a living.

Besides work and programming in my free time, I also enjoy doing outdoor activities like hiking, and cycling to downtown Toronto and back. When I'm stuck at home, I really enjoy watching classic movies from the 50s and later, such as films by Akira Kurosawa, and Stanley Kubrick. Finally, whenever I want to just relax on my own, one of my favourite ways to spend my time is explore beautiful worlds and stories by playing video games and space simulators. As a huge Sci-Fi fan, I find this is the closest way I can get to experiencing a glimpse of the future.

Anyways, I hope that you enjoy my projects and blogs! Make sure you stop by the comments to say hi!
