My name is George Ciesinski. I currently work as a L1 & L2 tech-support agent for a video conferencing company. I have been working in tech-support for nearly 10 years, ever since I became a student at Humber College and was hired as a work-study providing IT support to the college staff and students. 

I studied "Electro-mechanical Engineering - Robotics & Automation" where I learned how to design, build, and program automation lines for factories. Once I graduated, I got a job in the industry, but I quickly realized that I enjoyed the programming far more than designing or building. I left the industry and went back to studying. I learned Python and started to work on numerous projects. I built a program for my current company which saves users time by letting them create templates and recall them at any time by typing a shortcut. As L1 and L2 agents in my company were required to email many different kinds of templates to different customers, this program was adopted by my department with many agents reaching out to me to say that this has simplified their job and made it easier to perform their duties. 

After successfully creating a useful program used by my team, I realized that building useful tools is something that I enjoy doing and want to do every day. I am currently expanding my portfolio and learning as much as I can in pursuit of a future carreer in programming.
