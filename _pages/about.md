Hello World, I am a programmer who enjoys spending their free time outside of work learning about code.

I graduated from Humber College with an Advanced Diploma in Electro-mechanical Engineering - Robotics & Automation. While studying there, I learned how to design, build, and program various types of automation. I also learned various types of programming such as C++ and C#. After graduating, I learned Python and started to work on numerous projects. I built a program named TextScript for my current job which allows create text templates and recall them at any time by typing a shortcut. This program was adopted by a few departments in my company allowing agents to work . This only motovated me to pursue more projects, and start working to switch careers so I could program for a living.

Outside of programming, I also enjoy doing outdoor activities like cycling along the Toronto bike trails, or playing sports with friends. When I'm stuck at home, I like exploring cinema and playing video games.

Anyways, I hope that you enjoy my projects and blogs! Make sure you stop by the comments to say hi!
