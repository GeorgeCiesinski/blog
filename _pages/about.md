Hello, I am George Ciesinski. I am a programmer who enjoys spending their free time outside of work working on personal projects. I like building all sorts of things including helpful apps, APIs, and websites. I also like tinkering with Raspberry Pis and 3D printing.

I graduated from Humber College with an Advanced Diploma in Electro-mechanical Engineering - Robotics & Automation. I learned how to design, build, and program various types of automation. I also learned various types of programming such as C++ and C#. After graduating, I learned Python and started to work on numerous projects. I built a program named TextScript for my current job which allows create text templates and recall them at any time by typing a shortcut. This program was adopted by a few departments in my company allowing agents to work . This only motovated me to pursue more projects, and start working to switch careers so I could program for a living.

Besides work and programming in my free time, I also enjoy doing outdoor activities like hiking, and cycling to downtown Toronto and back. When I'm stuck at home, I really enjoy watching classic movies from the 50s and later, such as films by Akira Kurosawa, and Stanley Kubrick. Finally, whenever I want to just relax on my own, one of my favourite ways to spend my time is explore beautiful worlds and stories by playing video games and space simulators. As a huge Sci-Fi fan, I find this is the closest way I can get to experiencing a glimpse of the future.

Anyways, I hope that you enjoy my projects and blogs! Make sure you stop by the comments to say hi!
