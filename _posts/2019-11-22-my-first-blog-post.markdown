Hi All, 

This is my first blog post. Well... kind of. I used to run a blog on https://nova-technica.com, but this was earlier in my programming days. Unfortunately, due to personal circumstances, I had to shut this blog down. I simply didn't have the time to maintain it, and I didn't really have any idea what kind of scope the blog should have. I decided to restart the blog now that I am coding every day, and now that I have a specific scope for the blog.

# Scope

The scope of this blog will mostly be programming and computer science. I will explore many topics including: 

- Python
- Git & Github
- Bash
- 3D Printing
- Linux
- & much more

# Goals

I will be covering my pursuit of some of my short term and long term goals: 

## Short term

- Learning Jekyll to a more advanced level
- Changing the theme used on this site
- Building separate pages including a Resume page
- Completing several small and mid sized projects

## Long term

- Start a business tied to my programming
- Write at least one project I can monetize in some way
- The ultimate goal of my blog is to become a career software developer

# About Me

My name is George Ciesinski. I am an avid life-long student and spend much of my free time learning something new. I work as an IT professional and have had several IT jobs where I provided different kinds of support for clients. Although I enjoy this job, my dream is to become a proficient programmer and to get a job as a software developer. There's something about the challenge and the opportunity to build something others might find useful or efficient. 

I studied Electromechanical Engineering - Robotics & Automation in Humber College where I learned an array of different skills. The program prepared me for a career in automation, so I picked up a wide array of skills. A part of the program was learning about the physical processes, such as designing an automation line, material science, machining, and welding. We also learned lots of programming skills. As this was an automation class, we learned how to program various types of PLCs, articulated robots, and build computer software that can be used to interface with PLCs and Robots. 

The skills were invaluable to me, but my interests began to shift. First they started moving more towards computer science, and open source crafting. I started working with a 3D printer, and was learning more programming languages in an attempt to find something that grabbed my interest. Eventually, I discovered Python, which was exactly what I was looking for. This language made sense to me, and seemed so powerful. I devoted hundreds of hours to learning Python. Now, I am finally at the point where I can not only build small public projects in Python, but at a point where I have an idea of what kind of scope to have for my blog. 

I think that is enough about me for now. My future posts will be about my various projects. Please come visit again to see what new things I have been working on!
