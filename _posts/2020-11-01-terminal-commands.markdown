I have compiled useful Linux / Unix commands in this post, and will update it as I find more.

## cd

Change directory

```
cd directory
```

Change to parent directory

```
cd ..
```

## ls

Lists files and directories.

```
ls
```

Lists all files including .files

```
ls -a
```

## Tail

**-f** causes tail to loop forever

**-n100** Output the last *num* lines, instead of the default (10).

```
tail -f -n100 /folder/file.log
```
